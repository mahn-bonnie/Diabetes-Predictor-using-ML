# Diabetes-Predictor-using-ML

# Overview
 - This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related features.
 - It leverages machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.

# Features
Input features include:
 - Pregnancies
 - Glucose level
 - Blood pressure
 - Skin thickness
 - Insulin levels
 - BMI (Body Mass Index)
 - Diabetes Pedigree Function
 - Age

Target variable: Presence or absence of diabetes

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

 - Python (>=3.6)
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Scikit-learn
 - Matplotlib
 - Seaborn

Install dependencies using: 
 . pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
 
Follow the on-screen instructions to input health-related data after cloning the repository

# Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Random Forest
- Model training and testing performed on the Diabetes dataset.

# Files and Directories

diabetes_predictor.py: Main script for user interaction and prediction.
model_joblib_diabetes: Pre-trained machine learning model saved using joblib.
data/: Directory containing the Diabetes dataset.

# Results

The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the testing dataset.
